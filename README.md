# phpForum
This is a forum with php and MySQL. It has login, register, forgotten password, recaptcha... 
Also there is an special user account for the admin, who is the only that can add and delete categories. 
Sorry, I am the admin, you are not! ;)
The style of the forum is a little like Stack Overflow, you can send a message but also you can publish
comments about a message. It should be possible to register, login, post messages, etc. 
Please note in order for this application to work properly it needs to be run on a server like Apache (i.e. XAMPP),
with support for PHP and MySQL.
If you have issues of concerns please contact me at ignaciogarcia198@gmail.com.
